* Kubemenu

Kubemenu is a selection of bash scripts, that use [[https://tools.suckless.org/dmenu/][dmenu]] in order to make it easy to perform simple kubernetes tasks:

- Select namespace
- Show container logs
- Exec into a container

** Why ?
- I have been using kubernetes since 2014, yet I still haven't been able to memorize the command to switch to an other namespace.
- Container related commands are so painful to write that I'll do anything to avoid them.
- Cool tooling like [[https://github.com/abrochard/kubel][kubel]], [[https://github.com/derailed/k9s][k9s]], etc are awesome, but they have limited context (e.g. `shell`, `editor` etc). I'd like to perform these tasks from anywhere, anytime!
- It`s the unix thing to do.
